In this work, we developed and rigorously stress-tested a novel non-invasive biomarker test, the simplified MyProstateScore2.0 (sMPS2), for accurate and early screening of clinically-significant prostate cancer. 

## Project Structure

- **[scripts/](./scripts/)**: contains all scripts to run sMPS model development and evaluation pipeline
	- Python scripts:
		- [01_train_prediction_methods.py](./scripts/01_train_prediction_methods.py): fits the prediction methods and estimates the feature importances from these learned models 
		- [02_aggregate_train_results.py](./scripts/02_aggregate_train_results.py): aggregates the training prediction and importance results across the many data splits, methods, and data preprocessing variants
		- [03_evaluate_prediction_methods.py](./scripts/03_evaluate_prediction_methods.py): evaluates the prediction methods on the test set given a particular choice of gene rankings and number of gene predictors
		- [04_aggregate_eval_results.py](./scripts/04_aggregate_eval_results.py): aggregates the test evaluation results across the many data splits, data preprocessing variants, gene ranking modes, and number of gene predictors
	- To run the full pipeline, the "driver" scripts should be run in sequential order, i.e., first [01_driver.sh](./scripts/01_driver_train_prediction_methods.sh), then [02_driver.sh](./scripts/02_driver_aggregate_train_results.sh), then [03_driver.sh](./scripts/03_driver_evaluate_prediction_methods.sh), then [04_driver.sh](./scripts/04_driver_aggregate_eval_results.sh)
- **[model_config/](./model_config/)**: model configuration file, specifying the models, hyperparameters, and feature importances under study
- **[functions/](./functions/)**: contains all functions necessary to reproduce sMPS model development pipeline
- **[notebooks/](./notebooks/)**: contains files to reproduce [supplementary PCS documentation](yu-group.github.io/sMPS2/)
